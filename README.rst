Python Project Template
=======================

This is a free to use Python project template for Python 2.7-3.7
that I use for all of my open source Python projects.
Hope that it's also useful to others! :)

How to use this template
------------------------

Change to the directory you want your project to be in::

    $ cd ~/Desktop

Install the `cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_ module via pip::

    $ python -m pip install cookiecutter
    
Then run cookiecutter to get the latest version of the template.
It'll ask you a few questions like your Github user name, repo name, etc::

    $ cookiecutter gh:SethMichaelLarson/python_project_template
    
Do a quick look at all ``.rst`` files to make sure the number of underlines is correct for titles. :)
And voila! Ready to be commited as your initial commit!

After this commit, you should sign up for the following services and set their permissions on Github:

Be sure to change the licenses everywhere if you're using something besides MIT and the year on the Copyright.
All of my Python projects are MIT, that's why I use it as a default. :)
